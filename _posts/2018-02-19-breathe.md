## PTBO Game Jam History
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. That event saw 11 games created.
  
Based on the response to, and success of, that initial foray, follow-up events continue to be held with continual growth and reach.
  
With the organization of **PTBO Game Jam 04**, a team of industry professionals continues to work together towards the continued success of the **PTBO Game Jam** to the benefit of the industry as a whole as well as participants. 
  
It’s estimated that more than 19 million Canadians identify themselves as "gamers," participating, at some level, in an industry which is expected to grow to a startling $100 billion market value come 2019.
