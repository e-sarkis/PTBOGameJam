**Matthew Davey**   
Founder &amp; Organizer
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront with support from the community and industry.
  
Based on the response to, and success of, that initial foray, follow-up events continue to be held with continual growth and reach. **PTBO Game Jam 05** is the latest in this series.
